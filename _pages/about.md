Hi, I'm Jacob! I'm from Singapore and Malaysia and have spent time in Canada, the US, and the UK. Currently, I am a Computer Science PhD student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/) advised by [Yingzhen Li](http://yingzhenli.net/home/en/) and [Marek Rei](https://www.marekrei.com/). My recent research interests have been in variational inference, generative models, and LLMs. Previously, I was a Research Intern at [Samsung AI Research](https://research.samsung.com/) (2025).

Before joining Imperial, I earned an MEng from the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/), and an HBSc at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I was fortunate to be advised by [Rahul Krishnan](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), and [Jonathan Kao](https://seas.ucla.edu/~kao/people_dir/jonathan_kao.html) at [UCLA SEAS](https://samueli.ucla.edu/). Lastly, I am grateful to my instructors, [Jimmy Ba](https://jimmylba.github.io/) and [David Duvenaud](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/), for sparking my initial interest in machine learning.

If you are interested in research or would like to collaborate, please feel free to email me!
