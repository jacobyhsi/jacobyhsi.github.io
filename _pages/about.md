I am a PhD candidate at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/) supervised by [Prof. Yingzhen Li](http://yingzhenli.net/home/en/) specializing in Applied Machine Learning. Before joining Imperial, I earned a Master of Engineering degree specializing in AI and ML from the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/) and an Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Statistics and Economics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I am also fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Rahul Krishnan](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and [Prof. Jonathan Kao](http://seas.ucla.edu/~kao/) at UCLA where I research novel machine learning architectures through deep generative modeling.

Anyone interested in working on machine learning applications, feel free to contact me by email!
