I am a Computer Science PhD student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/) supervised by [Yingzhen Li](http://yingzhenli.net/home/en/) and [Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye](http://www.demontjoye.com/). My recent research interests have been in Generative Models and Large Language Models within the tabular data domain.

Before joining Imperial, I earned an M.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence from the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/), and an H.BSc. in Computer Science, Statistics, and Economics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I was also fortunate to be advised by [Rahul Krishnan](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), and [Jonathan Kao](https://seas.ucla.edu/~kao/people_dir/jonathan_kao.html) at UCLA where I researched novel machine learning architectures through deep generative modeling.

Anyone interested in machine learning research, feel free to contact me by email!
